## February 2020 Experiments

This project contains a few of the coding things I've been experimenting with recently, including Typescript, post-style CSS styling, lazy loading of components with [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy), and an infinate scroll feature that makes use of the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to improve performance.

## Running locally

After installing dependencies, run `yarn start` in the project directory to run the application in development mode.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
